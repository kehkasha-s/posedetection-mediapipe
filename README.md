Calculate number of lunges using pose detection
I used pose landmarker project of mediapipe library.
Tt returns location of 33 parts of the body.
To calculate number of lunges i have made changes in PoseLandmarHelper class.
I have added logic for counting reps of each legs. I have added a progress bar also for the visualization purpose in camera fragment.
